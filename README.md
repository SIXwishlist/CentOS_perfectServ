CentOS perfectServ
==================

This script will install all you need to have a full configuration of ISPConfig 3 on a minimal & new CentOS 7 system.
It work with no guaranty and need to be improved for sure !

This work is based from http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect-server-centos-6.4-x86_64-nginx-dovecot-ispconfig-3
You have to read this documentation and the script itself before do anything with it.

You must have a fresh CentOS 7 installation, with nothing installed and full internet access.
During setup, you will be asked for prompt input for mysql, mailman, and ISPConfig setup.

It will install and configure :

* Epel and RPMForge repository
* Development Tools (cause we need to compile some packages)
* NTP Daemon
* NGINX, MariaDB, PHP
* phpMyadmin
* Dovecot, Postfix & getmail
* ClamAV
* Mailman
* Fail2Ban & Rootkit hunter
* PureFTPD
* Bind
* Jailkit
and launch the ISPConfig3 installer !

have fun !
